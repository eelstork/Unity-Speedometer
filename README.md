# Unity Speedometer

A simple project showing how to use location services to measure speed. The sample app reports helpful data (location coordinates, accuracy, sampling timeframe)

## Android 12 and Unity 2021 LTS compatible issue

A bug came with some changes to Android 12 from Google in February which weren't compatible with Unity 2021 LTS location service backend and Unity didn't bother to fix it in 2021 and instead fixed it in Unity 2022. The bug makes Android phones not update it's location for several kilometers so make sure to use Unity 2022 when running this project on an Android 12 phone.

## Accuracy

Deriving speed from location data works better at higher speed (say, over 20 km/h).

- Location services do not provide samples at regular intervals. Instead, samples are delivered as a result of the user moving around (getting a new sample while not moving can take up to a minute, in the meantime speed won't update).
- Location accuracy is limited. In a best case scenario (outdoors, clear sky), the maximum reported accuracy is ~5m.
- New samples reflecting increased accuracy may be provided out of turn. In a typical scenario the user move from indoors to outdoors, causing a not-same-accuracy sample to arrive, which then produces meaningless speed variations.

Backlogged  samples may be considered to refine the output. This approach is implemented using a confidence parameter.
Not receiving location updates while not moving is a problem. This is crudely addressed using a timeout ([an alternative][4]). 

With newer devices it is possible to leverage [Core Motion][1] or [equivalent][2] via a [custom plugin][3].

The method used here does not aim at producing smooth results. If you need smooth results, consider using extrapolation or accelerometric data.
